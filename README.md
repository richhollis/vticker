# VTicker

This project is based on the cool vTicker jQuery plugin implentation by JugBit.

The original project can be found here: http://www.jugbit.com/jquery-vticker-vertical-news-ticker/

This project uses the original code as a starting point but uses a method based implementation. 

Compared to the original, it does not support fading and the direction option is removed as the animation direction is based on next or previous item: up for next; and down for previous.

Please consider supporting the original author who has a Donate button on their page.
